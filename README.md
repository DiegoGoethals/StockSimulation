# Scala.StockSimulation.Solution
## Description
This is an application we had to create for a business class at Scala, a school for adult education.
the assignment was to create an app they could use to simulate buying, selling and delivering products but since this was an app for school, errors/ human mistakes had to be allowed

## How to run the project
- Download the project locally
- Make sure you have SQL Express server installed on your device and it has to be called SQLEXPRESS
- In Visual Studio open up your package manager console
- run `dotnet ef database update -p Scala.StockSimulation.Web`
- Run the app, best is IIS Express to make sure no visual bugs appear
- Now the project is running and you can test it out
